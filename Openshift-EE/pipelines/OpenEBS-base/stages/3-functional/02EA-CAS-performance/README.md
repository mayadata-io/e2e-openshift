### 02EA- Deploy Application using storage class with specific CAS parameters.

#### Description

The goal of this test is to deploy busybox application using storage class created with specific CAS parameters.

#### Prerequisites

      - name: ZvolWorkers
        value: < 4 >
```

- This job triggers the litmus experiments which deploy the application using CAS specific storage class.
- The litmus experiment receives the necessary parameters in form of pod environmental variables and updates the manifest files accordingly.
- The job Pumps data traffic and check application liveness.
- It checks if the application is running successfully.
