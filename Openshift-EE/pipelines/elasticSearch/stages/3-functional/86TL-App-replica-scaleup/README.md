- The litmus experiment receives the necessary parameters in form of pod environmental variables and updates the manifest files accordingly.
- This job deploy busybox statefulset application with two replicas using OpenEBS storage class and start data traffic in the application pod.
- Then it attempts to increase the application replica count to three using kubectl scale command.
- Finally, it Check if the new application pod is created and the ring is formed.
