### Install OpenEBS in GKE cluster.

#### Description

This job will deploy OpenEBS on GKE cluster and check if all the components are healthy.

#### Prerequisites

- The Konvoy cluster should be ready.

#### Procedure

- Check if all the OpenEBS components are installed using kubectl command `kubectl get pods -n openebs`
- Finally, this job updates the e2eresult CR with the actual result.

#### Expected Result

- This job should deploy OpenEBS components such as maya-apiserver, openebs-provisioner, openebs-snapshot-operator, openebs-ndm pods, openebs-admission-server and default cstor pool pods successfully.

#### Test Result
